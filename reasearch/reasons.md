# Reasons for Using Different Data Structure Types

Different data structures are used based on the type of problem being solved.

## 1. Linear Data Structures
Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue

Reasons:
- Easy to implement and understand
- Efficient for sequential data processing
- Require less complex memory management

---

## 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Examples: Tree and Graph

Reasons:
- Suitable for representing hierarchical or network relationships
- Faster searching and sorting compared to linear structures
- Efficient for large datasets

---

## 3. Algorithms
Algorithms work together with data structures to process data.

Reasons:
- Improve speed and performance
- Reduce memory usage
- Provide step-by-step solutions to problems
