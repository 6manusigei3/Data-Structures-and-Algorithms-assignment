# How Data Structures and Algorithms Work Within Systems

Data structures and algorithms are essential components of computer systems.

## Operating Systems
Operating systems use queues to manage processes and CPU scheduling.
Stacks are used to manage function calls and memory allocation.

---

## Databases
Databases use trees such as B-trees for indexing and fast searching of records.
Hash tables are used for quick data retrieval.

---

## Network Systems
Graphs are used to represent network connections.
Algorithms find the shortest and most efficient path for data transmission.

---

## Software Applications
Applications such as web browsers, text editors, and mobile apps use data structures internally to manage data efficiently.

---

## Conclusion
Data structures organize data in memory, while algorithms define how data is processed. Together, they improve system speed, efficiency, and reliability.
